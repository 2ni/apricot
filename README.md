# pyupdi
Python UPDI driver for programming "new" tinyAVR devices

pyupdi is a Python utility for programming AVR devices with UPDI interface
  using a standard TTL serial port.

  Connect RX and TX together with a suitable resistor and connect this node
  to the UPDI pin of the AVR device.

  Be sure to connect a common ground, and use a TTL serial adapter running at
   the same voltage as the AVR device.
